## Our contribution to the Internet
Since the studio has the necessary knowledge in typography and micro-typography and the ability to do creative development, we would like to set up a small javascript library that would allow, depending on the language, to correct some rules that are still impossible to implement.

The project is still in its very early stages, however, if you are interested, please contact us.
Any kind of help is appreciated.

The respository linked to this project is [tiny-type-rules](https://github.com/benitodotcool/tiny-type-rules).
